# Anatomy of a Servable app

Servable is a Node JS template that helps orchestrate protocols and their respective classes for the entire lifecycle of a server.
Servable is built on top of Parse Server and Express JS with the intention to handle protocols along the features Parse Server already serves.
Servable at its core is a template that works hand in hand with the servable-engine which handles all the heavy lifting of registering protocols, computing classes and their schemas, handling migrations and more.

## Components
- An Express app
- A Parse Server instance
- A Servable Engine


<SVGComponent 
Svg={require('./appstack2.svg').default} />


## Project structure
```bash
├── lib
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── protocols
│   │   ├── customProtocolA
│   │   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── customProtocolB
│   │   │   ├── ...
├── servable.config.js
├── .env
└── package.json
```

- The servable config is servable.config.js
- All server code is inside /lib
- The servable app entry point is lib/index.js
- The app protocol is in lib/app
- The local protocols are in lib/protocols


## System design of a full fledged local servable app
A fully functional servable deployment will use a few other components to run alongside a main servable app.
These components are installed and run automatically when using the quick start CLI command.
They are defined in the app protocol system's docker-compose file.
