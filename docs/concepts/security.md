# Security

Servable inherits the strong security features of Parse Server.

https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#security

Parse Server uses three mechanisms for ensuring data access security and restriction:
- ACLs
- Class protection
- Protected fields

Servable makes it easy to edit and audit a protocol's security as the class protection, generic ACLs and protected fields are statically defined in the schema files.
