# What is Servable 


Let's discover **Servable in less than 5 minutes**.
## A Node JS framework
Servable is a Node JS framework that speeds up and streamlines server development.
# Concept
## What is Servable
Servable is a Node JS framework built on top of Parse Server and tailored for protocols. It provides a concise, easy and scalable template to get the best of Parse Server and the protocols.

- Schema based classes and auto-migration 
- Templates for classes 
- Auto-binding with protocols
- Template for custom protocols

## Why Servable?
At @anak we created the protocols in our Node JS + Parse server project. What was an experience to ease the backend development quickly became a good practice that helped us keep a clean codebase. They worked so well we decided to streamline their integration with the code base for future projects. We were inspired by the powerful ways NextJs improved the React experience by providing an efficient template on top of it. Yet we did not want to hide the Parse Server framework behind ours as we truly love Parse. Servable allows to tap into all the existing and upcoming Parse features and yet it dramatically simplifies the development process. A well designed Servable project will comprise almost nothing more than the actual classes and business logic of the platform, other repetitive functions and behaviours will use existing protocols implemented by the community or entreprise-private protocols.

## Should you use Servable?
Servable is likely a good fit for you if ...

**...you love Parse Server**
There is no reason not to use Servable if you have previously used a Parse Server. 

**...you care about productivity and developer experience**
Servable provides a predetermined template that sets a clear developer's guideline
